Do you have an interesting project that uses Cadence? If so then we want to hear from you. Also if you have any news items, blogs, articles, videos or events where Cadence has been mentioned then that is good too. We want to showcase that our community is active and is doing exciting and interesting things.\n\nPlease see below for a short round up of things that have happened recently in the community.\n\nCommunity Related Office Hours\n\nOn the 12th January 2022 we held our first Cadence Community Related Office Hours.

            "summary": "Cadence historically has been using TChannel transport with Thrift encoding for both internal RPC calls and communication with client SDKs. gRPC is becoming a de-facto industry standard with much better adoption and community support. It offers features such as authentication and streaming that are very relevant for Cadence. Moreover, TChannel is being deprecated within Uber itself, pushing an effort for this migration. During the last year we’ve implemented multiple changes in server and SDK that allows users to use gRPC in Cadence, as well as to upgrade their existing Cadence cluster in a backward compatible way. This post tracks the completed work items and our future plans.\n\nOur Approach\nWith ~500 services using Cadence at Uber and many more open source customers around the world, we had to think about the gRPC transition in a backwards compatible way. We couldn’t simply flip transport and encoding everywhere. Instead we needed to support both protocols as an intermediate step ...",

We would like to talk to you!\n\nOur team has spent a significant amount of time working with users and partner teams at Uber to design, scale and operate their workflows. This helps our users understand the technology better, smooth their learning curve and ramp up experience, and at the same time allows us to get fast and direct feedback so we can improve the developer experience and close feature gaps. As our product and community grows, we would like to expand this practice to our users in the OSS community. For the first time ever, members of the Cadence team along with core contributors from the community will host bi-weekly office hours to answer any questions you have about Cadence, or workflow technology in general. We can also dedicate future sessions to specific topics that have a common intere ...",

This message caused some confusion in the community, so we would like to take this opportunity to clear things out.\n\nFirst of all, Uber is committed to the long-term success of the Cadence project. Since its inception 5 years ago, use cases built on Cadence and their scale have grown significantly at Uber. Today, Cadence powers a variety of our most business-critical use cases (some public stories are available here and here). At the same time, the Cadence development team at Uber has enjoyed rapid growth with the product and has been driving innovations of workflow technology across the board, from new features (e.g. graceful failover, [workflow shadowing] ...",
