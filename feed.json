Well we have some great information for you!\n\nCommunity member Chris Qin has written a short blog post that takes you through the the three main components that make up a Cadence application. Please take a look and feel free to give us your comments and feedback.\n\nThanks Chris for sharing your knowledge and helping others to get started.\n\nCadence Go Client v1.0 Released\n\nThis month saw the release of v1.0 of the Cadence Go Client.

Among these, the worker service is the most crucial focus for developers as it hosts the activities and workflows of a Cadence application. In this blog, I will provide a short tutorial on how to implement a simple worker service from scratch in Go.\n\nTo finish this tutorial, there are two prerequisites you need to finish first\nRegister a Cadence domain for your worker. For this tutorial, I've already registered a domain named test-domain\nStart the Cadence backend server in background.\n\nTo get started, let's simply use the native HTTP package built in Go to start a process listening to port 3000. You may customize the port for your worker, but the port you choose should not conflict with existing port for your Cadence backend.\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc main( ...",

In most cases, developers contribute activities and workflows directly to their codebases, and they may not have a full understanding of the components behind a running Cadence application. We receive numerous inquiries about setting up Cadence in a local environment from scratch for testing. Therefore, in this article, we will explore the components that power a Cadence cluster.\n\nThere are three critical components that are essential for any Cadence application:\nA running Cadence backend server.\nA registered Cadence domain.\nA running Cadence worker that registers all workflows and activities.\n\nLet's go over these components in more details.\n\nThe Cadence backend serves as the heart of your Cadence application. It is responsible for processing and scheduling your workflows and activities. While the backend relies on various dep ...",

Welcome to the latest of our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!\n\nPlease see below for a roundup of the highlights:\n\nCadence Release 1.0\n\nJust in case you missed it - at the end of April Cadence v1.0 was officially released. This release is a significant milestone for the project and the community. It indicates that we are confident in the stability of the code that we can recommend it and promote it widely to more users. Kudos to everyone that worked together to make this release happen.\n\nAnd the Uber team also gave Cadence a writeup on the Uber Engineering Blog so please take a look.\n\nCommunity Survey Results\n\nThe results of our Community Survey have been published and you can find [the details right here on our blog](https://cadenceworkflow.io/blog/2 ...",
