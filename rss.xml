            <description><![CDATA[Cadence is a powerful, scalable, and fault-tolerant workflow orchestration framework that helps developers implement and manage complex workflow tasks. In most cases, developers contribute activities and workflows directly to their codebases, and they may not have a full understanding of the components behind a running Cadence application. We receive numerous inquiries about setting up Cadence in a local environment from scratch for testing. Therefore, in this article, we will explore the components that power a Cadence cluster.

There are three critical components that are essential for any Cadence application:
A running Cadence backend server.
A registered Cadence domain.
A running Cadence worker that registers all workflows and activities.

Let's go over these components in more details.

The Cadence backend serves as the heart of your Cadence application. It is responsible for processing and scheduling your workflows and activities. While the backend relies on various dep ...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[We released a user survey earlier this year to learn about who our users are, how they use Cadence, and how we can help them. It was shared from our Slack workspace, cadenceworkflow.io Blog and LinkedIn. After collecting the feedback, we wanted to share the results with our community. Thank you everyone for filling it out! Your feedback is invaluable and it helps us shape our roadmap for the future.

Here are some highlights in text and you can check out the visuals to get more details:

Most of the people who replied to our survey were engineers who were already using Cadence, actively evaluating, or migrating from a similar technology. This was exciting to hear! Some of you have contacted us to learn more about benchmarks, scale, and ideal ...]]></description>

Community Survey
We've been talking about doing a community survey for a while and during February we sent it out. We are still collating the results so it's not too late to send in your response.

The survey takes 5 minutes and is your opportunity to provide feedback to the project and highlight areas you think we need to focus on.

Please take a few minutes to give us your opinion.

Cadence and Temporal
During user surveys we've had a few queries about whether Cadence and Temporal are the same project. The answer is No - they are not the same project but they do share the same origin. At a high level Temporal is a fork of the Cadence project. Both Temporal and Cadence are now being developed by different ...]]></description>

Closing Down Cadence Office Hours
We have been running Office Hours sessions every month since May last year. The aim was to give the community an opportunity to speak directly with some of the Cadence core developers and experts to answer questions on particular issues you may be having. We have found that the most preferred method for community questions has been the support Slack channel so have decided to stop this monthly call.

Thanks very much to Ender Demirkayaand the Uber team for making themselves available for these sessions.

Please remember that if you have question about Cadence or are facing a specific issue then  you can post your question in our #support Slack channel. If you al ...]]></description>
