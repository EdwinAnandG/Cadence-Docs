Please see below for a roundup of the highlights:

Getting Started with Cadence

Are you new to  Cadence and want to understand the basic concepts and architecture? Well we have some great information for you!

Community member Chris Qin has written a short blog post that takes you through the the three main components that make up a Cadence application. Please take a look and feel free to give us your comments and feedback.

Thanks Chris for sharing your knowledge and helping others to get started.

            <description><![CDATA[In the previous blog, we have introduced three critical components for a Cadence application: the Cadence backend, domain, and worker. Among these, the worker service is the most crucial focus for developers as it hosts the activities and workflows of a Cadence application. In this blog, I will provide a short tutorial on how to implement a simple worker service from scratch in Go.

To finish this tutorial, there are two prerequisites you need to finish first
Register a Cadence domain for your worker. For this tutorial, I've already registered a domain named test-domain
Start the Cadence backend server in background.

To get started, let's simply use the native HTTP package built in Go to start a process listening to port 3000. You may customize the port for your worker, but the port you choose should not conflict with existing port for your Cadence backend.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main( ...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Cadence is a powerful, scalable, and fault-tolerant workflow orchestration framework that helps developers implement and manage complex workflow tasks. In most cases, developers contribute activities and workflows directly to their codebases, and they may not have a full understanding of the components behind a running Cadence application. We receive numerous inquiries about setting up Cadence in a local environment from scratch for testing. Therefore, in this article, we will explore the components that power a Cadence cluster.

There are three critical components that are essential for any Cadence application:
A running Cadence backend server.
A registered Cadence domain.
A running Cadence worker that registers all workflows and activities.

Let's go over these components in more details.

The Cadence backend serves as the heart of your Cadence application. It is responsible for processing and scheduling your workflows and activities. While the backend relies on various dep ...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[We've had a short break but now we are back. Welcome to the latest of our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!

Please see below for a roundup of the highlights:

Cadence Release 1.0

Just in case you missed it - at the end of April Cadence v1.0 was officially released. This release is a significant milestone for the project and the community. It indicates that we are confident in the stability of the code that we can recommend it and promote it widely to more users. Kudos to everyone that worked together to make this release happen.

And the Uber team also gave Cadence a writeup on the Uber Engineering Blog so please take a look.

Community Survey Results

The results of our Community Survey have been published and you can find [the details right here on our blog](https://cadenceworkflow.io/blog/2 ...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[We released a user survey earlier this year to learn about who our users are, how they use Cadence, and how we can help them. It was shared from our Slack workspace, cadenceworkflow.io Blog and LinkedIn. After collecting the feedback, we wanted to share the results with our community. Thank you everyone for filling it out! Your feedback is invaluable and it helps us shape our roadmap for the future.

Here are some highlights in text and you can check out the visuals to get more details:

Most of the people who replied to our survey were engineers who were already using Cadence, actively evaluating, or migrating from a similar technology. This was exciting to hear! Some of you have contacted us to learn more about benchmarks, scale, and ideal ...]]></description>
