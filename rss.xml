Closing Down Cadence Office Hours
We have been running Office Hours sessions every month since May last year. The aim was to give the community an opportunity to speak directly with some of the Cadence core developers and experts to answer questions on particular issues you may be having. We have found that the most preferred method for community questions has been the support Slack channel so have decided to stop this monthly call.

Thanks very much to Ender Demirkayaand the Uber team for making themselves available for these sessions.

Please remember that if you have question about Cadence or are facing a specific issue then  you can post your question in our #support Slack channel. If you al ...]]></description>

Cadence Meetup Postponed

It's always great to get the community together and we had planned to run another Cadence Meetup in early November. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to get things organised so we've decided to postpone it. So please watch out for an announcement for the new Cadence meetup date.

Doordash Technnical Showcase Featuring Cadence

We have had some great feedback from people who attended Technical Showcase that was run this month by Doordash. It featured their financial products but also highlighted some of the key technologies they use...and guess what Cadence is one of them!

If you missed the session then you will be happy to know that it was recorded and we've inlcuded a link to the the recording on Youtube.
